# Box2D PhysicsEditor XML Parser

A Java library for parsing XML files generated by
[PhysicsEditor](https://www.codeandweb.com/physicseditor) into LibGDX's
[Box2D](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Box2d) objects.

## Usage

If you were to copy the file in this project from `src/test/resources/bugs.xml`
into your LibGDX project's `android/assets` folder, you could create a body for
the first bug using the following code:

```java
// you need a Box2D world to add the body to
World world = new World(new Vector2(0, -10), true);

// you'll need to create the body definition - PhysicsEditor doesn't support
// setting these attributes
BodyDef bodyDef = new BodyDef();
bodyDef.type = BodyDef.BodyType.DynamicBody;

// load the XML file
PEXML pexml = new PEXML(Gdx.files.internal("bugs.xml").file());

// create the body - this will also add it to the physics simulation
Body body = pexml.createBody("bug_0001", world, bodyDef, 1, 1);
```
